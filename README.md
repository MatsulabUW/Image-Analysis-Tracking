## Pipeline for time-series microscopy data on Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis

![main gif](https://github.com/Mdanishnadeem/Image-Analysis-Tracking/blob/main/main_image.gif)

## Overview 
This project aims to analyze the dynamics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, with a specific focus on the roles played by dynamin and actin across various membrane domains (apical, basal, and lateral). The dataset comprises 3D time-series data acquired using lattice light sheet microscopy coupled with fluorescence techniques.

Furthermore, this endeavor seeks to elucidate the distinct roles of proteins such as dynamin and actin in orchestrating endocytic events across the diverse membrane landscapes.
